# Farmington Data Tracker

This is a simple project where we keep track of how many wrs, run, games played each player on the database.json has. we run the code every week to post the results on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/dCB96RJDAH). 

## Getting Started

This code is not my version yet, so I will post here the instructions specified by @bluestonex63:


> Ok so the order is:
>
> first you run flags.py to get the updated database
>
> (it takes like 10 mins)
>
> Then you run runsupdater.py
>
> Then pbsupdater.py
>
> Then you have verifierupdater.py
>
> If you want to do a full verifier update you first have to run mods.py
>
> And to actually build the boards you have to use pbslb.py, vlb.py, runslb.py
>
> Oh and for the verifier script there is another script for the over 20k club
>
> Called 1dhareni.py
>
> And you have to manually clean out the output files before running the script
>
> Thats all ðŸ¤£
>
> The only important order is to run runsupdater.py before pbsupdater.py for the obsolete runs to be gaming
